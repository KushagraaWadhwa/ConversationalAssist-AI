DEBUG:root:Gemini Response Generated: It's possible that the ghost is just restless and needs to move around more. Maybe it's been stuck in the same place for too long and needs to get out and explore. Or maybe it's just bored and needs something to do. If you're comfortable with it, you could try encouraging the ghost to move around more. Maybe you could open the windows and doors and let some fresh air in, or you could play some music and encourage it to dance. You could also try talking to the ghost and asking it what it wants to do. Just be respectful and patient, and see what happens.
